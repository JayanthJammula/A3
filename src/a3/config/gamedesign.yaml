    playerSprite: |
      anime style, top-down, 64x64px, adventurer with tunic and brown hair, walk + idle frames.
    npcVillagerA: |
      Generate a 64×64 front-facing pixel-art NPC sprite of a young male villager: short chestnut hair with a subtle side part, simple facial features, wearing an olive-green tunic over an orange undershirt, dark brown knee-length breeches, and sturdy leather boots. Use crisp outlines, subtle dithering for smooth shading and volume, classic 16-bit RPG style on a transparent background.
    npcVillagerB: |
      Generate a 64×64 side-view pixel-art character sprite: a figure in a dark purple jacket with bright yellow sleeves, a pale blue undershirt, two-toned trousers (grey right leg, brown left leg), dark boots, and a matching purple cap with a light-blue band. Render with crisp outlines, subtle dithering for depth, and a classic 16-bit RPG style on a transparent background.  
    houseTile: |
      isometric 64x64px, wooden cottage, red roof, chimney, door & windows.

      Create a 64×64 pixel-art ground tileset composed of a 4×4 grid of sixteen 16×16 square tiles, each featuring a distinct earth-tone palette—from sandy beige and warm tan to rosy pink, olive green, and slate gray—with subtle pixel dithering and soft shading to suggest soil and stone texture. Render with crisp edges and a classic 16-bit RPG aesthetic on a transparent background.
    highGrassTile: |
      Create a seamless 64×64 top-down pixel-art grass tile, featuring dense individual blades in a variety of vibrant green shades, with subtle highlights and soft shadows to convey depth and texture, in the style of classic 16-bit RPG terrain.

      Create a 64×64 pixel-art deciduous tree sprite with a slender brown trunk and a lush, rounded canopy of clustered leaves in varying shades of green.

      A vertical, high‐resolution digital painting of a ruined medieval battlefield at dusk: a winding dirt path littered with broken swords, round shields bearing blue heraldry, battered helmets, wooden cart wheels, and crates leads toward a crumbling castle on a misty hill. Dramatic sunset light filters through heavy clouds, casting warm golden highlights and long shadows. Wisps of smoke rise from distant fires, while overhanging ivy and twisted tree branches frame the top of the scene. Rendered in richly detailed, painterly fantasy style with a cinematic, moody atmosphere.

intro_images: # Ensure this line starts at column 1
  intro1: > # Corresponds to prologueBG / images/image_0.png
    # intro1: A high-resolution digital painting of a solitary young man with tousled black hair and pale skin, seated at a modern office desk at night. He wears a crisp white button-down shirt with rolled-up sleeves, his hands resting on a black keyboard beside a simple mouse and a steaming coffee mug. Behind him, dimly lit cubicles, scattered monitors, and vertical blinds let in a cool, bluish glow that casts soft highlights and deep shadows across the scene. Render in a moody, semi-realistic anime-inspired style with fine linework, subtle painterly textures, and cinematic lighting.  

  intro2: > # Prompt for a second conceptual image (e.g., ethereal transition)
    # intro2: A high-resolution digital painting in a moody, semi-realistic anime style of a tired young man with tousled black hair slumped forward on an office desk at night. His cheek presses into scattered papers, one hand still reaching toward a backlit keyboard while a steaming coffee mug sits close by. Behind him, rows of dimly lit cubicle monitors and stacked paperwork recede under cool fluorescent ceiling lights, casting soft blue highlights and deep shadows. Render with fine linework, subtle painterly textures, and a cinematic atmosphere.  

  intro3: > # Prompt for a third conceptual image (e.g., energy surge)
    # intro3: Create a vertical, high-resolution fantasy anime illustration of a wide-eyed young man with tousled black hair, wearing a crisp white shirt and dark trousers, standing in awe before a towering goddess-like figure. She has flowing silver hair, a delicate golden crown of roses, and wears an ornate white and gold gown that radiates warm, ethereal light. They stand amid grand marble columns draped with sheer curtains, bathed in swirling stardust and soft golden rays. Render with fine linework, painterly textures, dramatic lighting, and a majestic, cinematic atmosphere.  

  intro4: > # Prompt for Exploration Scene Background / images/image_1.png (or conceptual)
    # intro4: Generate a vertical, high-resolution fantasy anime scene: a wide-eyed young man with tousled black hair, wearing a crisp white shirt and dark trousers, stands in awe before a towering, ethereal goddess. She has long silver hair adorned with a delicate golden rose crown, and wears an ornate white and gold gown that radiates soft, warm light. They are framed by grand marble columns draped in translucent curtains, with swirling stardust and gentle golden rays filling the air. Render in fine linework and painterly textures, with dramatic, cinematic lighting and a majestic atmosphere.  

  intro5: > # Prompt for a fifth conceptual image (e.g., return)
    # intro5: Generate a vertical, high-resolution fantasy anime portrait of a young man with tousled black hair, wearing a crisp white button-up shirt with rolled sleeves and a loosened black tie that drifts in the breeze. He stands centered in a radiant doorway of warm golden light, arms slightly outstretched, eyes wide with wonder. Delicate pastel light ribbons and sparkles swirl around him, framed by tall gothic columns and a faint stained-glass window behind. Render in a moody, semi-realistic anime style with fine linework, soft painterly textures, and dramatic, cinematic lighting.  

  # --- NEW PROMPTS ---
  titleScreen: >
    # titleScreen: Create a vertical, high-resolution digital painting of a lone young man in modern trousers and a white shirt standing in the center of a bustling medieval marketplace. He faces a cobblestone square lined with timber-framed stalls laden with bread, pottery, and wares, surrounded by villagers in simple period attire. Beyond the market, half-timbered houses give way to a misty valley crowned by a vast stone castle with soaring spires. In the overcast sky, leathery dragon-like creatures wheel among ghostly apparitions and a pale moon. Render in richly detailed, painterly fantasy style with warm morning sunlight casting long shadows and a soft atmospheric haze.  

  gameOverScreen: >
    # gameOverScreen: Faded Return
    moody, anime style. Shows the player character sprite (top-down view, small in frame) lying defeated or faded/ghostly in a dark, indistinct forest setting (similar to exploration area but darker, maybe raining). Alternatively, show the character slumped back in the office chair from intro1, screen dark, with faint, dying magical wisps around them. The words "Game Over" or "Rebirth Denied" appear subtly faded into the background.
    ATMOSPHERE: Defeat, loss, failure, somber, quiet despair.
    STYLE: Dark tones, desaturated colors, soft focus, vignette effect, melancholic lighting.
